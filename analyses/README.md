# Using Analysis Modules in Single cell ATAC-sequencing Workflow (scATAC-seq)

This repository contains a collection of analysis modules designed to process and analyze single-cell ATAC (scATAC-Seq) data from 10X sequencing technology. 

**Analysis modules**

Each module is self-contained and can be executed independently or as part of a larger analysis pipeline. Below is a summary of each analysis module, including whether they are required or optional. Furthermore, the analysis modules should be run in the following recommended order:

1. `fastqc-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for FastQC quality control tool for high throughput sequence data analysis.", required=True)

The analysis modules are currently being developed. Please check back later for updates!

2. `cellranger-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for running and summarizing Cell Ranger count for single or multiple libraries.", required=True)
3. `upstream-analysis` module (description="Pipeline for estimating QC metrics and filtering low quality cells.", required=True)
